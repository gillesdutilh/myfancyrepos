# myfancyrepos
just as fancy as always

What can I do here? 
just write about stuff? No, it's also code, right? how? I try:

    x = mean(1:10)
    print(x)
    # And this too.
  
Why not.

Pretty fancy Gilles.

You can also highlight code like this

```r

a_sum <- sum(iris$Sepal.Width)
a_sum

```

There you see how ugly <- is :)
